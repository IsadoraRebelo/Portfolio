<h1>Projects </h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">After around one year programing at Codam College, these are a few projects that I completed following the curriculum.  </p>

<h4>FDF </h4>
<p>The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping. For example, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars is a prerequisite condition to its conquest.</p> 

<p>As another example, comparing various 3D representations of an area of high tectonic activity will allow you to better understand these phenomenon and their evolution, and as a result be better prepared. </p>

<div class="project"> 
<div class="image fractol"> </div>
<h4>Fractol </h4>
<p>A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. </p> 

<p>Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc.  </p>

<div class="project"> 
<div class="image wolf"> </div>
<h4>Wolf3D </h4>
<p>This project uses the raycasting technique used in Wolfstein 3D.</p> 

<p>Wolfenstein 3D is a seminal game in the pantheon of early video games. Developed by Id Software by the über famous John Carmack and John Romero, published in 1992 by Apogee Software, Wolfenstein 3D is the first true “First Person Shooter” in the history of video games. Embodying the American spy Willian “B.J.” Blazkowicz, the player attacks and decimates the Nazi army (and another army of zombies while he is at it) with the support of destructive weapons one more lethal than the next. </p>

<h1 style="text-align: right;">Ai branch </h1>
<div class="container"> 
<div class="project"> 
<div class="image fillit"> </div>
<h4>Fillit </h4>
<p>Fillit is a project that let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.</p> 

<p>A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to the popular game Tetris. </p>

</div>

<div class="project"> 
<div class="image pushswap"> </div>
<h4>Push Swap </h4>
<p>This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.</p> 

<p>The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.</p>

<div class="project"> 
<div class="image corewar"> </div>
<h4>CoreWar </h4>
<p>Corewar is a very peculiar game. It’s about bringing “players” together around a “virtual machine”, which will load some “champions” who will fight against one another with the support of “processes”, with the objective being for these champions to stay “alive”.</p> 

<p>The processes are executed sequentially within the same virtual machine and memory space. They can therefore, among other things, write and rewrite on top of each others so to corrupt one another, force the others to execute instructions that can damage them.</p>

<h1>About me </h1>
<p>I like to think of myself as an easygoing person, always looking for new challenges and never satisfied with unanswered questions. And truthfully I don’t remember how I started with Photoshop and Adobe Assets, but somehow that grew into a love for HTML and CSS. And over a year ago I started coding in C at Codam. So it feels like I’ve always been growing and evolving towards my final form, a software developer. Now that I have this knowledge I realise how much I could do. Suddenly I see how tech could benefit my favourite football players and how it could even improve my experience as a consumer of sports and sporting goods.</p> 

<p>Codam coding college teaches code the same way that I learned how to remove unwanted objects from my friends photos and how to build an entire skin for a forum. I learned that through asking my peers, Google and most importantly through trial and error. Cause the only thing worse that failing is never trying.</p>

<h1>Codam's philosophy </h1>
<p>One of the keys to Codam’s success is the peer-to-peer learning model. Peer-to-peer learning means: you find the answers to any issue through your research and help from your peers. You ask the people around you for help, help those around you when asked, and discover together how to solve problems you did not (yet) know how to solve. With your peers and the internet, there is nothing you cannot solve. An integral part of Codam is going beyond programming: learning how to learn. Only by learning to learn and work with others you can stay up to date with the latest developments.</p>
