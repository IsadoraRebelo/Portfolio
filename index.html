<h3>Projects </h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">After around one year programing at Codam College, these are a few projects that I completed following the curriculum.  </p>

<h4>FDF </h4>
<p>The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping. For example, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars is a prerequisite condition to its conquest.</p> 

<p>As another example, comparing various 3D representations of an area of high tectonic activity will allow you to better understand these phenomenon and their evolution, and as a result be better prepared. </p>

<div class="project"> 
<div class="image fractol"> </div>
<h4>Fractol </h4>
<p>A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. </p> 

<p>Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals. For instance: trees, rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, seashells, hurricanes, etc.  </p>

<div class="project"> 
<div class="image wolf"> </div>
<h4>Wolf3D </h4>
<p>This project uses the raycasting technique used in Wolfstein 3D.</p> 

<p>Wolfenstein 3D is a seminal game in the pantheon of early video games. Developed by Id Software by the über famous John Carmack and John Romero, published in 1992 by Apogee Software, Wolfenstein 3D is the first true “First Person Shooter” in the history of video games. Embodying the American spy Willian “B.J.” Blazkowicz, the player attacks and decimates the Nazi army (and another army of zombies while he is at it) with the support of destructive weapons one more lethal than the next. </p>

<h3 style="text-align: right;">Ai branch </h3>
<div class="container"> 
<div class="project"> 
<div class="image fillit"> </div>
<h4>Fillit </h4>
<p>Fillit is a project that let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.</p> 

<p>A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to the popular game Tetris. </p>

</div>

<div class="project"> 
<div class="image pushswap"> </div>
<h4>Push Swap </h4>
<p>This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.</p> 

<p>The Push_swap project is a very simple and highly effective algorithm project: data will need to be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/IsadoraRebelo/PushSwap"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> </a>
</div>

<div class="project"> 
<div class="image corewar"> </div>
<h4>CoreWar </h4>
<p>Corewar is a very peculiar game. It’s about bringing “players” together around a “virtual machine”, which will load some “champions” who will fight against one another with the support of “processes”, with the objective being for these champions to stay “alive”.</p> 

<p>The processes are executed sequentially within the same virtual machine and memory space. They can therefore, among other things, write and rewrite on top of each others so to corrupt one another, force the others to execute instructions that can damage them.</p>

<h3>C# </h3>
<div class="container"> 
<div class="project"> 
<div class="image maze"> </div>
<h4>Maze-Algorithm </h4>
<p>The goal of this test is to generate a perfect maze using an algorithm of your choice. </p>
<p>A perfect maze is defined as having no loops or closed circuits, and no inaccessible areas. In a perfect maze, any two points are connected through a singular, unbroken path.</p>

<h3>About me </h3>
<p>What moves you? Because speaking for myself, I was never good at stay in the same place if I do not feel that I'm being learning anymore. Moving to other cities, or changing schools, later even going to leave in other countries. New challenges, and places, are what keeps me moving, I believe the world is too big to stay in only one place. </p> 

<p>As a kid, I would spend a lot of time playing computer games with my cousins. I guess, because of the time I was spending at the computer, my mother just assumed I could fix whatever problem she would have with technology. Well, not the entire truth, but I knew where to look for the answers and, in the end, solve the problem.  And to be honest, I don’t remember how I started with Photoshop and Adobe Assets, but somehow that grew into a love for HTML and CSS. </p>

<p>Sport is another big part of my life. Even identifying myself as a crazy football fan, was basketball that I played for four years in high school and a few more months on my Canada's exchange. Sports can teach you from responsibility to teamwork and is a tool that can change lives. </p>

<p>Lucky for me, the technology in the sports field is just growing year by year, being at a personal level, like smartwatches, or in the professional one with data analysis. Now with all the background, I build, alongside the years, I want to be part of these changes, and more importantly, help to make them. </p>

<p>Like everything in my life, I want to give a shot, want to try and have the experience. Cause the only thing worse than failing is never trying. </p>

<p>By the way, I'm right now looking for my new challenge to start an internship! So, if you know something or have to offer, reach me out on LinkedIn, the link is below.</p>

<h3>Codam's philosophy </h3>
<p>One of the keys to Codam’s success is the peer-to-peer learning model. Peer-to-peer learning means: you find the answers to any issue through your research and help from your peers. You ask the people around you for help, help those around you when asked, and discover together how to solve problems you did not (yet) know how to solve. With your peers and the internet, there is nothing you cannot solve. An integral part of Codam is going beyond programming: learning how to learn. Only by learning to learn and work with others you can stay up to date with the latest developments.</p> 

<p>You can check more about Codam and the 42 Schools on the last link above. </p>
